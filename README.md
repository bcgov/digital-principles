# Principles for Digital BC

British Columbia's approach to Digital Government is a work-in-progress, the initial framework for which has been set out at https://digital.gov.bc.ca/. What follows is a draft set of principles - fundamental propositions - intended to serve as the foundation for a system of behaviors to guide the work of the Digital BC community.

An initial draft of the principles, [v. 0.1](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-principles/blob/master/BC_Draft_Digital_Principles_v.0.1.pdf), was posted in November 2019. The principles have since been refined in response to feedback from the community. The latest draft, v. 0.2, has been posted here to solicit further feedback. A future iteration of the Digital Principles will be included on https://digital.gov.bc.ca/. 

## Digital Principles in Context

These Digital Principles are envisioned to be part of an interconnected set of guidance and standards for all BC Public Service employees engaged in applying the culture, processes, business models and technology of the digital era to meeting the needs and expectations of the people of British Columbia: 

* Our British Columbia Public Service Oath of Employment (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/managers-supervisors/managing-employee-labour-relations/oath_of_employment.pdf) and Standards of Conduct (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/standards-of-conduct);
* These (DRAFT) Digital Principles, which explicitly and very intentionally incorporate the Draft Principles that Guide the Province of British Columbia's Relationship with Indigenous Peoples (https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion-respect/draft_principles.pdf); 
* As called for in the Digital Framework, an in-development Service Standard, intended to guide digital era teams to create and run great public services, no matter the channel through which those services are delivered (i.e. whether digital or not); and
* Modeled again after leading jurisdictions, for those using technology to build government products and services, an in-development Technology Code of Practice, a set of criteria to help government design, build and buy technology. This Code of Practice is intended to be used as a cross-government agreed standard for the development of new digital (IMIT) products and services.

## Draft Digital Principles v. 0.2

### 1.       Prioritize delivering impact for British Columbians
Recognize that government digital products and services should ultimately improve people’s lives. Focus on meeting citizens’ needs and expectations and on improving service delivery. Build products and services for outcomes rather than outputs. Deliver consistently and sustainably through judicious use of public resources.

### 2.       Design with people & embed inclusion
Deliver simple, effective products and services via human-centered design practices with the people who will actually use the product or service. Apply the highest standards of accessibility, inclusion and equity at every stage of product and service design, development and delivery.

### 3.       Integrate ethics
Design or modify digital products and services with ethics in mind. Evaluate potential uses of emerging technologies to consider possible ethical, social and cultural implications. Ensure there is clear oversight and documentation for automated decision-making processes (e.g.: when using artificial intelligence).

### 4.       Continuously learn & improve
Iterate and improve products and services to support learning and innovation. Use modern tools and approaches. Be flexible to change, seeking and accepting ongoing user feedback. Test early and often. Start small and scale up.

### 5.       Work in the open
Collaborate, co-design and co-create with users transparently. Default towards open licenses, open and interoperable standards, open information and data, and open-source code.

### 6.       Take an ecosystem approach
Design and deliver solutions that are forward-thinking, adaptable and scalable. Support enterprise approaches and common or interoperable components. Share work and learnings with the aim of contributing to the wider community. Strive to collect data from users only once, re-using and sharing data whenever possible. 

### 7.       Take care of information & data
Manage information, including data, as a public asset in accordance with its value and user needs. Strive to improve the quality of information and data, incl. by developing standards to help ensure that data and information may be used to benefit citizens. Apply rigour around decision-making, using data to take a fair, ethical and evidence-based approach. Act as a trusted information steward.

### 8.       Manage risks proportionately
Promote a risk-balanced approach that addresses security and privacy. Design clear and flexible risk mitigation strategies.

### 9.       Build internal capacity
Empower all public servants to deliver excellent digital products and services. Create and support teams with diverse skillsets, providing them with technology, tools and training. Encourage innovation and controlled experimentation. Build an organizational culture that supports constant learning and engagement through the use of technology.

### 10.      Express cultural & historical awareness & respect
Acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and discrimination created by government; work in the spirit of reconciliation and [B.C.’s Draft Principles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/careers/about-the-bc-public-service/diversity-inclusion-respect/draft_principles.pdf) guiding our relationship with Indigenous peoples.
